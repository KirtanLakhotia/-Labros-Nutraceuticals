    <p class="cordyceps-text">A randomized controlled trial published in <strong>Scientific Reports (2024)</strong> demonstrated that 
        <strong>Cordyceps militaris</strong> exhibits potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects, which 
        help combat oxidative stress and inflammation-related diseases.</p>

        <h2 class="cordyceps-heading">What was the study about?</h2>
        <p class="cordyceps-text">Scientists wanted to test if taking <strong>Cordyceps militaris</strong>, a type of medicinal mushroom, could
            help improve health by reducing two major problems:</p>
        <ul class="cordyceps-list">
            <li><strong>Oxidative stress</strong> – when harmful molecules (free radicals) damage our cells.</li>
            <li><strong>Inflammation</strong> – the body’s response to injury or illness, which, if uncontrolled, can
                lead to diseases like diabetes, heart problems, and arthritis.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="cordyceps-section">
        <h2 class="cordyceps-heading">What did they do?</h2>
        <ul class="cordyceps-list">
            <li>They conducted a randomized controlled trial (a reliable scientific method).</li>
            <li>Two groups of people participated:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>One group took <strong>Cordyceps militaris</strong> supplements daily.</li>
                <li>The other group took a placebo (a harmless pill with no active ingredients).</li>
            </ul>
            <li>The trial lasted for several weeks, and researchers measured markers of oxidative stress and inflammation in their blood.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="cordyceps-section">
        <h2 class="cordyceps-heading">What did they find?</h2>
        <ul class="cordyceps-list">
            <li>The group that took <strong>Cordyceps militaris</strong> had lower levels of oxidative stress.</li>
            <li>They also had reduced inflammation, which could help lower the risk of chronic diseases.</li>
            <li>Overall, the participants reported feeling more energetic and healthier.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="cordyceps-section">
        <h2 class="cordyceps-heading">What does this mean for you?</h2>
        <p class="cordyceps-text">Taking <strong>Cordyceps militaris</strong> as a supplement might be a natural way to protect your cells, 
            reduce harmful inflammation, and potentially improve your energy and overall health.</p>
