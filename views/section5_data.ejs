        <h2 class="cordyceps-heading">What was the study about?</h2>
        <p class="cordyceps-text">The brain can get damaged when exposed to oxidative stress, a process where harmful molecules (free radicals) attack and injure brain cells. This damage is linked to brain-related conditions like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases. The researchers wanted to see if <strong>Cordyceps militaris</strong>, a medicinal mushroom, could protect brain cells from this kind of damage.</p>

    <div class="cordyceps-section">
        <h2 class="cordyceps-heading">What did they do?</h2>
        <ul class="cordyceps-list">
            <li>The scientists used brain cells in the lab and exposed them to oxidative stress to mimic the damage that happens in real life.</li>
            <li>Then, they treated the damaged cells with <strong>Cordyceps militaris</strong> extract to see how it affected the health of the cells.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="cordyceps-section">
        <h2 class="cordyceps-heading">What did they find?</h2>
        <ul class="cordyceps-list">
            <li><strong>Cordyceps militaris</strong> protected brain cells from oxidative damage.</li>
            <li>It worked by:
                <ul>
                    <li>Neutralizing harmful free radicals, which reduces the stress on brain cells.</li>
                    <li>Boosting the cells' natural defense systems, helping them survive and recover.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>This suggests that <strong>Cordyceps militaris</strong> may help prevent or slow down the damage that leads to neurodegenerative diseases.</li>
        </ul>

    <div class="cordyceps-section">
        <h2 class="cordyceps-heading">What does this mean for you?</h2>
        <p class="cordyceps-text">This study shows that <strong>Cordyceps militaris</strong> might be beneficial for brain health. It could help protect your brain from damage caused by oxidative stress, which is often linked to aging and diseases like Alzheimer's. While this is promising, more research is needed to confirm these effects in humans. If you're interested, talk to a doctor before trying any supplements!</p>
